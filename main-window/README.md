# Template for creating a main window

This creates a functioning main window with a customized menu bar, status bar, window title, and icon. The program runs from run.py

If using MainWindow class as a template, subclass it and reimplement the self.menu() and self.menu_operations() functions, and direct run.py to import and call the subclass.

The window is set to scale to desktop screen size with 150 pixels space on each side. The window will centre on screen when opened.
