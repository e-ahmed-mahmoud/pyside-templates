# Template for creating a main window

This creates a functioning main window with a customized menu bar, status bar, window title, and icon. The program runs from run.py

If using MainWindow class as a template, subclass it and reimplement the self.menu() and self.menu_operations() functions, and direct run.py to import and call the subclass.
